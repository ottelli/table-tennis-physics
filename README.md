# Table Tennis Physics Model
This is a Matlab program with a GUI that I made for an assignment at university.
<br/>
The task was to model some projectile motion and evaluate the effects of some change in conditions.
<br/>
Based on an April Fools article where the International Table Tennis Federation proposed to change the size of the table to make the game more exciting to watch, I chose to model whether this might actually be the case.

## The Model
* 3-d projectile motion
* Aerodynamic drag and lift force
* Spin effects (Magnus Lift)
* Ballistic transition (drag and lift dependent on turbulence and spin rates)
* Projectile impact

## The Program
I made a GUI to input all the initial conditions for the motion, with suggestions to mimic standard table tennis shots. The model would then plot the trajectory of the shot and show some meaningulf statistics like the time of flight to the end of the table (response time for an opponent) and ball velocity at the end of the table.
<br/>
It's possible to pan and zoom in 3-d around the table to examine the trajectory.

## Results
I was able to model the trajectories of various standard table tennis shots, and compare the effects of changing the table size. Together with the accompanying report, the model recieved 90/100 (70 for a Distinction grade).
